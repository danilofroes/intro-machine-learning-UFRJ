O projeto é para o desenvolvimento de uma biblioteca em python de machine learning para otimizar a produção de múltiplas pipelines e gerar insights úteis de retorno para o usuário sem a necessidade de construção de grandes códigos.\n",

    "- `id_solicitante`: Identificador único, não é necessário para o modelo.\n",
    "- `grau_instrucao`: Veio preenchida apenas com zeros.\n",
    "- `possui_telefone_celular`: Veio preenchida apenas com `'N'`.\n",
    "- `qtde_contas_bancarias_especiais`: Idêntica a outra coluna, `'qtde_contas_bancarias'`.\n",

    "#### **Substituição de valores nulos ocultos**\n",
    "Foi observado pelo dicionário de dados, que existem valores nulos que estão ocultos no dataframe, ou seja, não seriam enxergues como nulos no pré-processamento. Valores como `\"XX\"`, espaços em branco `\" \"`, `NULL`, dentre outros serão substituídos por valores nulos NaN.\n",

    "#### **Engenharia de Features**\n",
    "Essa parte foi essencial para melhor o potencial de predição dos modelos. Aqui foi estudado um pouco de todas as features que tínhamos e como poderíamos unir algumas para criar outras com maior valor de predição.\n",
    "- `renda_total`: Essa feature foi criada realizando a soma da `renda_mensal_regular` e da `renda_extra`.\n",
    "- `patrimonio_por_renda`: Essa feature foi criada com intuito de trazer a relação de patrimônio e renda para a predição, utilizando o `valor_patrimonio_pessoal` dividido pela `renda_total`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Tratamento de valores extremos**\n",
    "Foi constatado em algumas features dados que fugiam muito da curva padrão. Dessa forma, para evitar overfitting, realizei o tratamento desses dados.\n",
    "- `qtde_dependentes`: Esse dado foi limitado a 10 depedentes, pois tinham algumas situação onde os valores extrapolavam a realidade.\n",
    "- `idade`: Foi considerado que menores de 17 anos não pudessem realizar"
