    "\n",
    "Este notebook documenta o processo de desenvolvimento de um modelo de regressão para o segundo trabalho da disciplina EEL891. O objetivo central é estimar o preço de venda de imóveis a partir de um conjunto de características, como tipo, bairro, área e comodidades.\n",
    "\n",
    "A abordagem seguirá as melhores práticas de um projeto de Machine Learning, incluindo uma análise exploratória de dados (EDA) aprofundada, engenharia de features, otimização de hiperparâmetros e a construção de um modelo de ensemble robusto. O sucesso do projeto será medido pela métrica **Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE)**, que guiará nossas decisões de modelagem.\n",

    "### **3. Análise da Variável Alvo (`preco`) e Definição da Métrica**\n",
    "\n",
    "A etapa mais crucial em um problema de regressão é entender a natureza da variável alvo.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1. Distribuição e Transformação Logarítmica\n",
    "\n",
    "O histograma da variável `preco` revela uma forte **assimetria positiva** (*right-skewed*), com uma grande concentração de imóveis em faixas de preço mais baixas e uma cauda longa de imóveis de altíssimo valor. Essa característica é problemática para muitos algoritmos de regressão, pois os valores extremos (outliers) podem influenciar desproporcionalmente o treinamento, e a violação da premissa de normalidade dos resíduos pode degradar a performance do modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solução padrão e mais eficaz para este cenário é a **transformação logarítmica**. Aplicamos a função $y_{log} = \\log(1 + y_{original})$ para normalizar a distribuição. O uso de `log1p` (equivalente a $\\log(1+x)$) é uma prática robusta que garante validade matemática mesmo que existam valores nulos (preço = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Como o segundo gráfico demonstra, a aplicação da transformação resulta em uma distribuição muito mais simétrica e próxima de uma distribuição Gaussiana. Isso estabiliza a variância e melhora a performance e a convergência da maioria dos algoritmos de regressão. Nosso modelo será treinado para prever o `log(preco)`, e a transformação inversa (exponencial, $e^x - 1$) será aplicada na predição final.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2. Métrica de Avaliação: RMSPE\n",
    "\n",
    "A métrica de avaliação definida para a competição é a **Raiz Quadrada do Erro Percentual Quadrático Médio (RMSPE)**. Sua fórmula é:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{RMSPE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{y_i - \\hat{y}_i}{y_i} \\right)^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Onde:\n",
    "- $n$ é o número de amostras.\n",
    "- $y_i$ é o preço real do imóvel $i$.\n",
    "- $\\hat{y}_i$ é o preço previsto para o imóvel $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diferente do RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), o RMSPE mede o erro em termos **percentuais**, pois a diferença $(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)$ é normalizada pelo valor real $y_i$. Isso significa que um erro de R$20.000 em um imóvel de R$200.000 (erro de 10%) é penalizado muito mais do que o mesmo erro de R$20.000 em um imóvel de R$2.000.000 (erro de 1%). A métrica, portanto, valoriza a precisão do modelo especialmente nas faixas de preço mais baixas."

    "### **4. Engenharia de Dados**\n",
    "Dados brutos raramente estão em um formato ótimo para a modelagem. Esta etapa fundamental consiste em limpar, transformar e enriquecer o dataset para extrair o máximo de informação preditiva, preparando o terreno para que os algoritmos de machine learning performem com máxima eficácia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Todo o processo foi encapsulado em uma única função, `processar_features`, para garantir que as mesmas transformações fossem aplicadas de forma idêntica e consistente tanto ao conjunto de treino quanto ao de teste. A premissa central para evitar o vazamento de dados (*data leakage*) foi respeitada: toda e qualquer estatística de ajuste (medianas, médias, etc.) foi calculada **exclusivamente** a partir do conjunto de treino e, em seguida, aplicada a ambos os conjuntos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1. Tratamento de Dados\n",
    "\n",
    "A primeira fase consistiu em garantir a qualidade e a consistência dos dados.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correções Lógicas:** Foram aplicadas duas correções de consistência:\n",
    "    1.  Imóveis com `area_util` igual a zero foram tratados como dados faltantes e preenchidos com a mediana, pois um imóvel não pode ter área nula.\n",
    "    2.  Casos onde o número de `suites` era maior que o de `quartos` foram corrigidos, igualando o valor de `suites` ao de `quartos`. Essa correção remove uma impossibilidade física e melhora a integridade lógica do dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2. Transformação de Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Seguindo a mesma lógica da variável alvo `preco`, as features numéricas `area_util` e `area_extra` também apresentavam forte assimetria. Aplicamos a transformação logarítmica ($x_{log} = \\log(1+x)$) para normalizar suas distribuições, ajudando os modelos baseados em árvores a criarem pontos de corte mais eficazes e estáveis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.3. Engenharia de Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Esta é a etapa onde criamos novas variáveis com maior poder preditivo.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Features Simples:**\n",
    "    * `area_total`: A soma de `area_util` e `area_extra`, representando a dimensão completa do imóvel.\n",
    "    * `prop_suites_quartos`: Uma razão que pode indicar o nível de \"luxo\" ou modernidade da planta do imóvel.\n",
    "    * `total_diferenciais`: A soma das 10 colunas binárias de comodidades (churrasqueira, piscina, etc.). Funciona como um *score* de amenidades, quantificando o valor agregado da propriedade.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **5. Pré-processamento**\n",
    "\n",
    "Com os dados limpos e enriquecidos pela engenharia de features, a próxima etapa é estruturá-los nos formatos finais para o treinamento e definir o pipeline de transformações e a estratégia de validação que serão utilizados pelos nossos modelos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.1. Definição do Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Para garantir que as transformações sejam aplicadas de forma consistente, utilizamos um `Pipeline` do Scikit-learn. O coração desse pipeline é o `ColumnTransformer`, que nos permite aplicar lógicas de pré-processamento distintas para diferentes tipos de colunas.\n",
    "\n",
    "As duas decisões estratégicas adotadas aqui, após diversos testes com diversos tipos de pré-processamento diferentes, foram:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **One-Hot Encoding (OHE) para Todas as Features Categóricas:** Em vez de usar encoders diferentes para variáveis de baixa e alta cardinalidade, optei por aplicar o `OneHotEncoder` em todas, inclusive na feature `bairro`. O OHE converte cada categoria em uma nova coluna binária (0 ou 1). Isso cria uma matriz de features larga e esparsa, um formato que modelos baseados em árvores (nossos principais candidatos) conseguem processar de forma extremamente eficiente. Essa abordagem tem a vantagem de ser direta, não fazer suposições sobre a ordem das categorias e evitar o risco de *data leakage* que pode ocorrer com encoders baseados no alvo (como o `TargetEncoder`). O parâmetro `handle_unknown='ignore'` foi utilizado para garantir que o modelo não gere erros caso encontre uma categoria no conjunto de teste que não existia no treino.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Não Utilização de Scaler para Features Numéricas (`remainder='passthrough'`):** Optei por passar as features numéricas através do pipeline sem aplicar qualquer tipo de escalonamento (como `StandardScaler` ou `RobustScaler`). A justificativa para essa decisão é que os modelos que formam a base do nosso ensemble — **RandomForest, LightGBM e XGBoost** — são baseados em árvores de decisão. Esses algoritmos são fundamentalmente insensíveis à escala das features, pois suas decisões são baseadas em pontos de corte (ex: `area_util_log > 5.0?`) e não na magnitude dos valores. Essa simplificação torna o pipeline mais limpo e rápido, sem prejuízo à performance desses modelos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.2. Estratégia de Validação Cruzada Estratificada\n",
    "\n",
    "Para obter uma estimativa confiável da performance de generalização do nosso modelo, a validação cruzada (*cross-validation*) é essencial. Uma simples divisão K-Fold, no entanto, pode ser problemática em datasets com alvos de distribuição assimétrica como o nosso, pois um dos *folds* poderia, aleatoriamente, conter uma proporção muito maior de imóveis de alto valor, distorcendo a métrica de avaliação para aquela iteração.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para mitigar esse risco, implementei uma **Validação Cruzada Estratificada (`StratifiedKFold`)**. Embora seja uma técnica classicamente usada para classificação, nós a adaptamos para o nosso problema de regressão da seguinte forma:\n",
    "1.  Discretizamos a variável alvo contínua (`preco`) em 10 \"faixas\" ou *bins* de mesmo tamanho.\n",
    "2.  Utilizamos essas faixas como o critério para a estratificação.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isso garante que cada um dos 10 *folds* da validação tenha uma distribuição de preços (proporção de imóveis baratos, médios e caros) muito similar à do conjunto de dados completo. O resultado é uma estimativa de erro (RMSPE) muito mais estável e confiável, tornando nosso processo de otimização de hiperparâmetros mais preciso e representativo da performance real no conjunto de teste.\n"

    "### **6. Otimização de Hiperparâmetros com Optuna**\n",
    "\n",
    "Com os dados devidamente processados e a estrutura de validação definida, o próximo passo foi ajustar os **hiperparâmetros** dos nossos modelos base. Hiperparâmetros são as configurações do algoritmo que não são aprendidas durante o treinamento (como a profundidade de uma árvore ou a taxa de aprendizado), e encontrar a combinação ideal é crucial para extrair a máxima performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1. Uso da Optuna\n",
    "\n",
    "Para esta tarefa, eu optei por não utilizar abordagens tradicionais como o Grid Search (computacionalmente inviável para um espaço de busca grande) ou o Random Search (eficiente, mas não \"inteligente\"). Em vez disso, utilizei a **Otimização Bayesiana** através da biblioteca `Optuna`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Otimização Bayesiana é uma técnica de busca sequencial e inteligente. Ela funciona construindo um modelo de probabilidade (um \"surrogate model\") que mapeia os hiperparâmetros ao score da métrica de avaliação, ou seja, $P(\\text{score} | \\text{hiperparâmetros})$. A cada nova tentativa, o otimizador utiliza os resultados das tentativas anteriores para decidir qual a próxima combinação de hiperparâmetros é a mais promissora para explorar, através de uma \"acquisition function\". Esse método equilibra de forma eficiente a **exploração** (tentar áreas novas e desconhecidas do espaço de busca) e a **explotação** (focar em áreas que já se mostraram promissoras), convergindo para soluções de alta qualidade com muito menos iterações do que uma busca aleatória.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2. O Processo de Otimização\n",
    "\n",
    "Minha implementação se baseou em uma única função `objective` genérica, capaz de otimizar diferentes classes de modelos. Para cada modelo (RandomForest, LightGBM e XGBoost), um \"estudo\" do Optuna foi iniciado.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dentro de cada estudo, a função `objective` foi chamada 50 vezes (`n_trials=50`). Em cada chamada, o Optuna sugeriu um conjunto de hiperparâmetros, um pipeline foi construído e avaliado usando nossa robusta estratégia de validação cruzada (`StratifiedKFold`) e a métrica RMSPE. O score médio foi retornado ao Optuna, que o utilizou para refinar sua próxima escolha.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para o LightGBM, um ajuste importante foi a definição do objetivo como `regression_l1` (Erro Absoluto Médio), uma escolha inspirada pela análise de soluções de alta performance, que tende a tornar o modelo mais robusto a outliers. Ao final do processo para cada algoritmo, os melhores parâmetros encontrados foram armazenados para a construção dos modelos base do nosso ensemble final."

    "### **7. Modelo Final: Ensemble com Stacking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Após a otimização individual dos três modelos com melhores desempenhos em todos os testes (RandomForest, LightGBM e XGBoost), a fase final do projeto consistiu em combiná-los em um único modelo superior, utilizando uma técnica de ensemble avançada conhecida como **Stacking** (ou empilhamento).\n",
    "Nos testes gerais foram usados também os modelos DecisionTree, Ridge e LinearRegression.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.1. A Estratégia de Ensemble: Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Em vez de uma simples média de previsões, eu optei pelo Stacking por ser uma abordagem mais sofisticada e, geralmente, mais performática. A intuição por trás do Stacking é criar um \"comitê de especialistas\", onde um novo modelo, chamado de **meta-modelo**, aprende a melhor forma de combinar as previsões dos modelos base.\n",
    "\n",
    "O processo funciona da seguinte forma:\n",
    "1.  Os modelos base (RandomForest, LightGBM, XGBoost) são treinados utilizando a estratégia de validação cruzada (`StratifiedKFold`). As previsões que cada um faz nas porções de validação de cada fold (previsões *Out-of-Fold*) são coletadas.\n",
    "2.  Essas previsões \"fora da amostra\" são empilhadas para formar um novo conjunto de treino.\n",
    "3.  O meta-modelo é então treinado neste novo conjunto de dados, aprendendo a ponderar e combinar as previsões dos especialistas de forma otimizada para minimizar o erro final.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essa abordagem é poderosa porque o meta-modelo pode aprender padrões complexos, como dar mais peso a um modelo específico para certos tipos de imóveis ou quando os outros modelos discordam entre si.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.2. Componentes do Modelo de Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modelos Base:** Utilizei as três melhores versões dos modelos, com seus hiperparâmetros otimizados pela busca Bayesiana do Optuna. Para maximizar a **diversidade** do ensemble — o ingrediente mais crucial para o seu sucesso — eu configurei cada modelo com um `random_state` diferente. Isso garante que a aleatoriedade interna de cada algoritmo (ex: na seleção de features ou amostras) gere modelos ligeiramente diferentes, que cometem erros distintos e, portanto, se complementam melhor.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Meta-Modelo (`final_estimator`):** Para o meta-modelo, eu escolhi o `RidgeCV`. Trata-se de uma Regressão Linear com regularização L2 e validação cruzada interna para encontrar o melhor parâmetro de regularização (alpha). A escolha de um modelo linear simples e regularizado como meta-modelo é uma prática padrão e robusta, pois ele combina as previsões de forma eficaz sem o risco de se sobreajustar a elas (*overfitting*), garantindo uma boa generalização.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.3. Treinamento e Geração da Submissão\n",
    "\n",
    "O `StackingRegressor` foi inserido em um `Pipeline` final junto com o `preprocessor`. Este pipeline completo foi então treinado com 100% dos dados de treino (`X` e `y`). Por fim, o pipeline treinado foi utilizado para gerar as previsões no conjunto de teste (`X_test`), que foram revertidas da escala logarítmica para a escala original de preço para criar o arquivo de submissão final."

    "### **8. Ensemble com Média Ponderada**\n",
    "\n",
    "Como parte do processo de busca pelo melhor modelo possível, eu implementei e avaliei uma segunda estratégia de ensemble, baseada em uma **média ponderada** das previsões dos modelos base. O objetivo era comparar a performance de uma combinação explícita e direta com a abordagem mais complexa do `StackingRegressor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A metodologia foi a seguinte:\n",
    "1.  **Treinamento Individual:** Cada um dos três modelos base (RandomForest, LightGBM e XGBoost), já com seus hiperparâmetros otimizados, foi treinado individualmente no conjunto de treino completo.\n",
    "2.  **Previsão Individual:** Cada modelo treinado foi então utilizado para gerar um conjunto de previsões para os dados de teste.\n",
    "3.  **Combinação por Média:** As três listas de previsões (ainda na escala logarítmica) foram combinadas através de uma média. Inicialmente, optei por uma média simples, atribuindo um peso igual de 1/3 para cada modelo, representando uma combinação imparcial de suas \"opiniões\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Essa abordagem tem como vantagens a simplicidade, a interpretabilidade e o controle direto sobre a contribuição de cada modelo. No entanto, conforme observado nos resultados da competição, o score obtido por este método foi inferior ao do `StackingRegressor`. Isso sugere que a relação ótima entre as previsões dos modelos base era mais complexa do que uma simples combinação linear, e que o meta-modelo `RidgeCV` do Stacking foi capaz de aprender essa relação de forma mais eficaz, resultando em um modelo final mais preciso."

    "### **9. Ensemble por Média de Ranks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Após construir múltiplos modelos de ensemble de alta performance (o `StackingRegressor` e a `Média Ponderada`), a estratégia final para alcançar o topo do ranking foi combinar as minhas melhores submissões de uma forma ainda mais robusta: através da **média de ranks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9.1. A Lógica por Trás do Rank Averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "A média direta dos preços previstos é eficaz, mas sensível a outliers. Se um dos modelos, por alguma razão, fizesse uma previsão absurdamente alta ou baixa para um único imóvel, esse valor poderia distorcer significativamente a média final.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ao converter as previsões de preço para **ranks** (ou seja, da 1ª posição - mais barata - até a 2000ª posição - mais cara), eu descartei a magnitude absoluta do preço e mantive apenas a **ordem relativa** das previsões de cada modelo. Isso torna a combinação não-paramétrica e extremamente robusta a outliers e a diferentes escalas de previsão entre os modelos.\n",
    "\n",
    "O processo foi o seguinte:\n",
    "1.  Eu carreguei minhas duas melhores submissões, geradas por estratégias de ensemble distintas.\n",
    "2.  As previsões de preço de cada arquivo foram convertidas em seus respectivos ranks usando a função `rankdata` da biblioteca SciPy.\n",
    "3.  Calculei a média dos ranks para cada imóvel, obtendo um \"rank de consenso\" que representa a sabedoria coletiva dos meus melhores modelos.\n",
    "4.  Para garantir que a submissão final tivesse uma distribuição de preços realista (e não apenas valores de rank), eu mapeei esse rank de consenso aos preços ordenados da minha melhor submissão individual. Essa etapa final preserva a ordem robusta do *rank averaging*, mas a veste com a escala de preços plausível do meu melhor modelo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essa técnica, que combina a força de diferentes estratégias de ensemble de forma estável, provou ser decisiva."

    "\n",
    "O objetivo deste projeto foi desenvolver um modelo de regressão de alta performance para estimar os preços de imóveis, culminando na participação em uma competição. Através de um processo iterativo de análise, engenharia de features e modelagem avançada, a solução desenvolvida não apenas cumpriu, mas superou as expectativas.\n",
    "\n",
    "O resultado final foi um **ensemble por média de ranks** que combinou as previsões de um modelo de Stacking e de um modelo de média ponderada, alcançando um score RMSPE final de **0.2418** e a **primeira posição** no ranking da competição.\n",
    "\n",
    "A jornada até este resultado consolidou diversos aprendizados cruciais:\n",
    "* A **Análise Exploratória** e a **transformação logarítmica** de variáveis assimétricas (tanto alvo quanto features) foram fundamentais para a estabilidade e performance dos modelos.\n",
    "* A **Engenharia de Features** se provou a etapa de maior impacto, onde a criação de variáveis contextuais, como as estatísticas por bairro, enriqueceu drasticamente o poder preditivo do dataset.\n",
    "* A **Otimização de Hiperparâmetros**, especialmente com uma abordagem inteligente como a Otimização Bayesiana (Optuna), foi essencial para extrair o máximo de cada algoritmo base.\n",
    "* A **Arte do Ensembling** foi o grande diferencial. O projeto demonstrou uma clara hierarquia de performance: modelos individuais foram superados por ensembles de média simples, que por sua vez foram superados pelo Stacking, com o ápice sendo alcançado pela combinação robusta de diferentes estratégias de ensemble através da média de ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Este trabalho serve como uma demonstração prática de um fluxo de trabalho de machine learning completo e competitivo, validando a eficácia de uma metodologia estruturada e da persistência no refinamento de cada etapa do processo."
